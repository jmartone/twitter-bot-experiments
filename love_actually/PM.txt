 I must work on my wave. How are you?

 Cool. Powerful.

 Yes, I would like that very much indeed. Anything to put off actually running the country.

 Good morning. I had an uncle called Terence -hated him - I think he was a pervert - but I very much like the look of you.

 Hello, Pat.

 Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot - no nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

 Hello, Natalie. 

 That’s fine...You could've said "fuck" and we'd have been in real trouble.

 Yeah, I can't see why not.

 That is so inconvenient.

 OK. What's next? 

 Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play. Alex?

 Right. Right. I understand that but I have decided...not to. Not this time. We will of course try to be clever, but let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world. I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

 Right – now who do you have to screw around here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

 Yup, come in.

 Excellent. Thanks a lot.

 Thanks very much. Thanks... Natalie.

 Natalie. NATALIE: Sir.

 Thanks. Natalie. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about us working in such close proximity every day and me knowing so little about you, it seems élitist and wrong.

 Where do you live, for instance?

 My sister lives in Wandsworth. So which exactly is the dodgy end?

 Right, yes. that is dodgy and you live with your husband? Boyfriend, three illegitimate but charming children? – 

 Oh. I’m sorry. 

 I beg your pardon?

 Right...You know, being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered.

 Do - the SAS are absolutely charming - ruthless, trained killers are just a phone call away.

 Oh, God. Did you have this kind of problem? Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

 Mr President!

 Come through. I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it by the way.

 Yes. Pathetic, isn't it? Just never been able to tie a girl down.

 Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome, whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

 Very jealous of your plane, by the way. 

 Ah, Natalie. Hi.

 Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

 Right, thanks, Alex. I don't think we're making progress here. Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

 Well, now, that was an interesting day.

 Absolutely. There is one final thing to look at. It's very close to my heart. Just give me a second.

 Hi. Pathetic.

 Er, yes, Peter.

 I love that word "relationship". Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?I fear that this has become a bad relationship. A relationship based on the President taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm...

 All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy and important, how can I help you?

 You can't always be sensible. 

 Oh, dear. It's the Chancellor on the other line. 

 I'll call you back.

 Yeah, erm, Mary, I have been thinking. Can we move the Japanese ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

 Terrific. Thanks so much.

 Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat. Ah..Need you to do a favour for me.

 Don't ask me why, and don't read stuff into this,it's just a weird personality thing. But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?

 Ooh, would we call her chubby?

 Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...I'm sure she's a lovely girl but I wonder if you could, erm...redistribute her?

 Yeah.

 Thank you very much.

 Jack, yeah, I need a car. Right now. Thank you. Oh, don't wait up.

 I'd like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.

 Oh, God, I have absolutely no idea and it's the longest street in the world and.

 Hello, does Natalie live here?

 Er, yes. In fact, I am. Merry Christmas. Part of the service now. Trying to get round everyone by New Year's Eve.

 Ah. Hello. Does Natalie live here?

 Oh dear. Okay.

 Er, no. No, I'm not.

 Well, I suppose I could.

 All right.

 Hello. Sorry to disturb. Does Natalie live here? 

 Ah. Brilliant.

 Yes and I'm sorry about all the cock-ups. Not my fault. My cabinet are absolute crap. We hope to do better next year. Merry Christmas to you.

 Ah. Hello. Is, er, Natalie in?

 Hello.

 Very nice to meet you.

 Well, I... just needed Natalie...on some state business.

 No – look, I don't want to make you late for the concert.

 Listen, why don't I give you a lift and then we can talk about this “state business” business in the car.

 How far is this place? 

 Ah, right. Well, er...I just wanted to say...thank you for the Christmas card.

 Oh, wow. That really was just round the corner. Well, look, I think I'd better not come in, you know? Nobody wants some politician stealing the kids' thunder.

 No, I'd... I'd better not. But I will be very sorry to drive away from you.

 OK. Terry, I won't be long. Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

 Oh, how are you? Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. Are you alright?

 Well, you know... 

 I thought it was about time I did. I just didn't want anyone to see, so I'm just going to hide myself somewhere and watch the show. Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

 You are welcome.

 Right. Well, this is Gavin. My copper. And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...- who's my, erm, catering manager. 

 Probably.

 Right. So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

 Smile. Little bow. And a wave.

 God, you weigh a lot.
