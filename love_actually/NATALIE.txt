 Hello, David. I mean, sir. Shit, I can't believe I just said that. And now I've gone and said "shit". Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

 Thank you, sir. I did have an awful premonition I was going to fuck up on my first day...oh, piss it!

 These have just come through from the Treasury...and these are for you.

 I was hoping you'd win, not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

 Well, there's not much to know.

 Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

 At the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

 No, I've just split up with my boyfriend, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

 No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him. He said I was getting fat. 

  He said no one's going to fancy a girl with thighs the size of big tree trunks. Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

 Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.

 I'II, erm... I'll be going, then.

 Thank you, sir.

 Where the fuck is my fucking coat? - Oh. Hello. 

 Erm, this is my mum and my dad and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

 And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.

 And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

 Too much detail, Mum. 

 No, it's nothing, really. 

 No, really, it doesn't matter. 

 Okay.

 Just round the corner.

 You're welcome. Look, I'm so sorry about that day. I mean, I came into the room, and he slinked towards me and there was a fire and he's the President of the United States and nothing happened, I promise. I just felt like such a fool because...I think about you all the time, actually. - And I think you're the man that I really... 

...Iove. 

 No, please come. It'll be great.

 Just give me one second.

 Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

 Don't worry. This was my school. I know my way around. Come on.

 Hi. 

 I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir, just because it's Christmas.

 What do we do now?

 Oh, shut our face.
