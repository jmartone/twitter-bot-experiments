 Bonjour.

 Thank you very much but no. If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.

 Just don't go eating it all yourself, you're getting chubbier every day.

 Nao! Eu peco imensa desculpa.

 Que desastre.

 Fuck - it's cold!

 This stuff better be good.

 I don't want to drown saving some shit my grandmother could have written.

 What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?

 Try not to disturb the eels.

 Maybe you could name one of the characters after me.

 What kind of book is it?

 Romance? 

 Thriller... crime...

 Frightening?

 I'd better get back to work. And then later you'll drive me home?

 It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you.

 Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia. Grande, er... grande familio, grande tradizione de Christmas presents. Stupido.

 Thank you. Erm, it was, erm...I will miss you. And your very slow typing...and your very bad driving.

 Boa noite, Jamie.

 Thank you. That will be nice. Yes is being my answer. Easy question.

 Yes, of course.

 Just in cases.

 Jamie's friends are so good-Iooking. He never tells me this. I think maybe now I have made the wrong choice, picked wrong Englishman.
