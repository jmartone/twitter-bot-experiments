 Oh, yes, of course, great, er, good, good. How you doing, Mia? You settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

 Now, switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here?

 And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

 I thought as much.

 Yes.

 Yes.

 I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.

 Invite him out for a drink - then after twenty minutes casually drop into conversation the fact that you’d like  to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.

 Yes. And so does Karl. Think about it, for all our sakes. It's Christmas.

 Right, the Christmas party. Not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise.

 It's basic, really. Find a venue, over-order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.

 Yeah. I mean, not children. But wives and girlfriends, et cetera. Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend you’ll be bringing, have you? 

 Really? Right.

 Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

 How true.

 And of course, your mobile goes.

 So, how's the Christmas party going?

 What's it like? 

 Oh. Right.Good. Well, I suppose I should take a look at it or something.

 What is this we're listening to?

 I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

 Did she? Oh, well, that's good, I must write to her and say thanks.

 You're a saint.

 Yeah, sure, sure. As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.

 You're looking very pretty tonight.

 Sorry?

 Don't be ridiculous.

 I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

 Is she?

 Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping, never an easy or pleasant task.

 Er...I don't know, I hadn't thought.

 Where's Sarah, by the way?

 There's a word for hangover I've never heard before. See you later. 

 So are you gonna give me something?

 So, erm, what do you need? Something along the stationery line? Are you short of staplers?

 Right. Right.

 Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

 Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.

 Yes, all right. 

 Look, could we be quite quick? 

 That's great.

 I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket. 

 Really?

 Ooh! Could we be quite quick, please?

 What's that? 

 Actually, I really can't wait. 

 Want to bet?

 Almost finished? Are you gonna dip it in yogurt? Cover it with chocolate buttons?

 I don't want a Christmas box.

 I did but...

 Can I pay?

 No, no, no, no. No bloody holly. 

 Leave it-just leave it Ooh!

 No. I was just looking around.

 Can't a man have any secrets?

 Let Mummy go first.

 I have bought the traditional scarf as well but this is my other, slightly special, personal one.

 To continue your emotional education.

 My brilliant wife.

 What position is that?

 Oh, Karen...

 Oh, God. I am so in the wrong. A classic fool.

 Matter of fact, I did.

 How are you?
