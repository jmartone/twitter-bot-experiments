 You really want to know? 

 Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?

 Okay. Well truth is, actually...I'm in love.

 I know I should be thinking about Mum all the time and I am but the truth is I'm in love and I was before she died and there's nothing I can do about it.

 No.

 Why? 

 Worse than the total agony of being in love?

 Yup. 

 SHE doesn't even know my name. And even if she did, she'd despise me. She's the coolest girl in school and everyone worships her because she's heaven.

 I got some terrible news today.

 Joanna's going back to America. 

 Yes, she's American. And she's not my girl. And she's going back to America. That's the end of my life as I know it.

 I trust you.

 There was for Kate and Leo.There was for you.And there is for me. She's the one.

 Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.

 Daniel!I have a plan. 

 Well, girls love musicians, don't they? Uh-huh.Even the weird ones get girlfriends. 

 Whatever. There's this big concert at the end of term and Joanna's in it. I thought if I was in the band and played superbly, she might fall in love with me. What do you think?

 That I don't play a musical instrument? 

 A tiny, insignificant detail.

 No. But the thing about romance is people only get together right at the very end.

 By the way, I feel bad. I never ask you how your love life is going.

 I'm not hungry.

 Look at the sign on the door.

 Thanks. Plan didn't work, though.

 Tell her what?

 No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

 OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.

 Just give me one sec.

 OK, I'm back. Let's go.

 Tell her.

 You know...

 Look, there she is.

 Over there. Oh, no.

 What?

 You think I should?

 OK.

 Joanna.

 I thought you didn't know my name.

 Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

 There she is.

 Hello.
