 Absolutely. Horrible moment right now though - can I call back?

 Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned that your wife just died.

 So what's this big news?

 The lobster? 

 In the Nativity play? 

 There was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus?

 That's not unusual. My horrid son Bernard stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.

 At the age of 11?

 Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time. Just be patient. And maybe check the room for needles.

 Get a grip. People hate sissies. No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.

 Have you gone completely insane?

 You can if you're Prime Minister.'

 No, it isn't!

 No, you won't!

 The trouble with being the Prime Minister's sister is it puts your life into rather harsh perspective. What did my brother do today? He stood up and fought for his country.

 Joni Mitchell.

 I love her and true love lasts a lifetime. Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught your cold English wife how to feel.

 Which doll shall we give Daisy's little friend Emily?

 I suppose I'd better do the duty round.

 Some more than others.

 That was a good night. Except I felt fat.

 It's true. Nowadays the only clothes I can get into were once owned by Pavarotti.

 Mia's very pretty.

 You know she is, darling. Be careful there.

 Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off Bernie at rehearsal.

 Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied for ten minutes while I do 

 Loitering around the jewellery section?

 Don't worry. My expectations are not that high after 13 years of Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

 Explain again why you're so late. 

 Well, hurry up, we've been waiting for hours, it's the first ever preview.

 No, no, no. I want to choose mine. I think I want......this one. 

 Thank you. That's a real first.

 I'm going to…All right, I'll rip it.God, that's a surprise.

 It's a CD. Joni Mitchell, wow.

 Yes. Goodness. That's great.

 Ah, yes. Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself for a second? All that ice cream. Er...Darling, could you make sure the kids are ready to go? I’ll be back in a minute.

 David. 

 What the hell are you doing here?

 I always tell your secretary that these things are going on but it never occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

 I have to say - I've never been gladder to see my stupid big brother. Thank you. 

 Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

 Catering manager. Watch out he keeps his hands off you. 20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

 Showtime. Quickly. See you after? 

 Thank you, Prime Minister. 

 I'll see you later, all right? I'll speak to you. Bye.... Tell me, if you were in my position, what would you do?

 Imagine your husband bought a gold necklace and, come Christmas, gave it to somebody else.

 Would you wait around to find out... Night, darling. Happy Christmas.... would you wait around to find out if it's just a necklace or if it's sex and a necklace or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love? Would you stay? Knowing life would always be a little bit worse? Or would you cut and run?

 Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me. You've made the life I lead foolish, too... Darling. Ooh, darlings! Oh, you were wonderful. My little lobster, you were so... What is that word? Orange. Come on, I've got treats at home. Dad's coming. 

 I'm fine. I'm fine. Good to have you back. Come on. Home.
