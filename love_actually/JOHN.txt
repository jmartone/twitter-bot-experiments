 By the way, he introduced me as John but everyone calls me Jack.

 Great, Just Judy!

 The traffic today was just... 

 Absolutely. Isnâ€™t always the case. I was standing in for Brad Pitt once on Seven Years In Tibet...bloody freezing...

 I promise I won't look.

 OK, right, okay. Is that all right?

 I'll warm them up!

 Right. It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it? Total gridlock this morning.

 So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?

 You know the type - married to his job. Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

 I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure, it's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.

 Look, erm...sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you? I mean, nothing implied. Just maybe go and see something Christmassy or something. Obviously, if you don't want to, you don't have to. I...I'm rambling now, sorry.

 Oh, great.

 You know, that is really great. Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages to get the courage up, so thank you.

 Of course, yeah. It's getting a bit cold. Well, good night. 

 Right. Thank you. Good night.

 All right?

 I might get a shag at last.

 Got to go.
