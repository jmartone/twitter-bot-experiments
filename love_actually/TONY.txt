 Why is that?

I think it's crap, Colin.

 You don't have a cute British accent. 

 Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole, and you must accept it.

 Judy, could you take your top off this time - lighting and camera need to know when we're actually going to see the nipples and when we're not.

 Sorry, guys, time's pretty tight and we have to get the actors in.

 And Jerry says, if you could just put your hands on her breasts?

 And massage them, please. 

 Judy, if you could just lower the nipples and cheat them a bit to the left?

 And the move again, please, Judy.

 What?

 No. 

 No!

 No, Col! There are a few babes in America, I grant you, but they're already going out with rich, attractive guys.

 That is total bollocks. You've actually gone mad now.

 No, Colin, no! 

 Nyet! 

 Nein! 

 What are you doing here?

 You're not actually going ahead with this stupid plan?

 You'll come back a broken man. 

 You are on the road to disaster.

 Hey. What are you two doing here?

 Hello, Harriet.
