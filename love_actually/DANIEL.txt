 Karen, it's me again. Sorry, I literally don't have anyone else to talk to.

 Of course.

 Understood. Bugger off and call me later.

 Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment. Some of her requests, for instance, that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral, I was confident she expected me to ignore. But others she was pretty damn clear about. When she first mentioned what's about to happen, I said, "Over my dead body." And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine." And as usual, my darling girl...and Sam's darling mum was right. So she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but, inevitably, ever so coolly, through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers...

 He now spends all the time in his room. I mean, he'll be up there now.

 Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time. I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know? I mean, clearly it's about his mum, but Christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.

 Well, maybe not his eyeballs, maybe just his veins.

 The problem is, it was his mum who always used to talk to him and I donâ€™t know... the whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter, like it never did before.

 And then when he sometimes does come out, it's obvious he's been crying. It was such a ridiculous waste. And if it's now going to ruin Sam's life as well...I just don't know.

 Yeah. Absolutely. Helpful.

 So, what's the problem, Sammy-o? Is it just Mum or is it something else? Maybe...school? Are you being bullied? Or is it something worse? Can you give me any clues at all?

 I really want to know.

 Even if that's the case.

 Sorry?

 Aren't you a bit young to be in love? 

 Okay, right. Well I'm a little relieved.

 Because I thought it'd be something worse.

 Ahmm...No, you're right. Total agony.

 We can definitely crack this. Remember, I was a kid once, too. So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

 And what does she/he, feel about you?

 Good. Good. Well, basically...you're fucked, aren't you?

 Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

 Let's have it.

 Your girl's American?

 That is bad news.Well, we need Kate and we need Leo, and we need them now. Come on.

 Do you trust me? 

 Fool! Get off, you big bully. AII right, open your eyes.'

 Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

 Thank the Lord. Tell me.

 That's right. Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once. For God's sake, Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.

 I think it's brilliant, I think it's stellar. Apart from the one obvious tiny little baby little hiccough

 Yes, sir.

 Has she noticed you yet? 

 Of course.

 No. As you know, that was a done deal long ago. Unless Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case I want you out of here straight away, you wee motherless mongrel. We'll want to have sex in every room, including yours.

 Sam, time for dinner. 

 Sam, I've done chicken kebabs.

 Right.

 Sammy! Fantastic show! Classic drumming, son.

 Tell her, then.

 That you love her.

 Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose and you'll always regret it if you don't. I never told your mum enough. I should have told her every day because she was perfect every day. You've seen the films, kiddo. It ain't over till it's over.

 Yes!

 Yeah.

 That's OK. My fault.

 Yeah. Stepdad, actually. Daniel.

 Carol?

 Yeah. Well... I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

 Yeah? Good.

 What?

 Don't be such an arse.

 Where?

 It's OK, we'll go to the airport. I know a short cut.

 Look, we're not actually flying.

 Not even to let the boy say goodbye to the love of his life?

 I'm sorry, Sam.

 Unless...

 Do you want to make a run for it?

 Yeah.

 Yes!

 Aw, he should have kissed her.
