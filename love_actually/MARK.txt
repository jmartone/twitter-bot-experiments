 No surprises.

 Unlike the stag night.

 I do.

 That is true. Good luck, kiddo.

 Yeah, I'm mature now.

 No, thanks.

 WHO?, what?

 No. No. No is the answer. No, absolutely not.

 Yes. This DJ, what do you reckon? The worst in history? 

 He's done it, it's official. 

 Actually, they're not funny. They're art. (On the phone) OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

 I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it, so don't get any hopes up. Must go.'

 Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

 I hope it's useful. Don't show it around too much. Needs a bit of editing. Look, I've got to get to a... lunch. Early lunch. You can just show yourself out, can't you? It's a... self-preservation thing, you see.

 Enough. Enough now.

 Just thought I'd tag along.
