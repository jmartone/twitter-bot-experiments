 God, I'm so late. 

 You sure you don't mind me going without you?

 I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting.

 Right. Did I mention that I love you? 

 Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

 The lady of the house let you in, did she? 

 Lovely, obliging girl. I thought I'd pop back before the reception, see if she was better. Listen, I've been thinking. I think perhaps we ought to take Mum out for her birthday on Friday. What do you think? I just feel we've been bad sons this year. 

 Alone again. Naturally.

 Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

 No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

 I think you're not surprised.

 Yeah, yeah.

 Er, bonjour, Aurelia. 

 Er, je suis, er, tres heureux de vous avoir ici.

 Ah, ah, buongiorno. Eusebio, er, er... Er, molto bueno...

 Right. Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

 Oh, absolutely, yes. Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

 Bello. Er, bella. Er, mon-montagno, arvarez...

 No, right. Silence is golden. As the Tremeloes said. Clever guys,although I think the original version was by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons. Gr-great band. Oh, shut up.

 Erm. Would you like the last, er...?

 That's all right, more for me.

 I'm very lucky I've got a constitution where I never put on weight.

 Hello.

 Thank you..

 Oh, no. Hold on. God, it's half the book. Oh, no.

 Just leave them, please! They're not important.They're not worth it! Stop! Stop! It's all just rubbish. Just leave it.

 Oh, God, she's in….And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.

 Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

 It's not worth it, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

 Just stop. Stop.

 I really must do copies. You know there'd better not be eels in here. I can’t stand eels.

 Oh, what the hell is that?

 Thank you. Thank you so much. I know. I'll name one of the characters after you.

 Or I could give you 5% of the profits.

 Sim.  Crime. Crime, murder.

 Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.And, er, sometimes not. 

 Sure. It's my favourite time of day...driving you.

 Well, goodbye.

 (Portuguese) Oh, my God, I've got a terrible stomachache.

 My goodness, this is a very big fish! It tastes delicious!

 Yes, oh, splendid. It's lovely to see you all. And, er...I'm off, actually.

 Sorry. Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

 Good evening. Senhor Barros?

 I am here to ask your daughter for her hands in marriage.

 Yes.

 Pardon me. I'm meaning your other daughter - Aurelia.

 Boa noite, Aurelia.

 Beautiful Aurelia... I've come here with a view to asking you... to marriage me. I know I seems an insane person because I hardly knows you but sometimes things are so transparency, they don't need evidential proof. And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.

 Of course I don't expecting you to be as foolish as me, and of course I prediction you say no... but it's Christmas and I just wanted to... check.

 You learned English?

 Here she is. This is Aurelia. This is Juliet. This is Peter. Mark, didn't see you there.

 She can't speak English properly.
