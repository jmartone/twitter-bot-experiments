 Did you do this?

 Mark? '

 It was great. Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

 It's only a tiny favour. I've just tried the wedding video and it's a disaster.

 I remember you filming a lot and I wondered if I could look at it.

 Please. All I want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

 Banoffee pie?

 Thank God. You would've broken my heart if you'd said yes.

 Can I come in?

 I was just passing and I thought we might check that video thing out.

 Mark, can I say something?

 I know you're Peter's best friend and I know you've never particularly warmed to me.

 Great.

 There is one here that says "Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

 Do you mind if I...? 

 Oh. Oh, bingo. That's lovely. Well done, you.

 Oh, that's gorgeous. Thank you so much, Mark, this is exactly what I was hoping for. I look quite pretty. You've stayed rather close. They're all of me.

 But...you never talk to me.You always talk to Peter. You don't like me.

 I'll get it. Oh, hi. 

 ...It's carol singers.
