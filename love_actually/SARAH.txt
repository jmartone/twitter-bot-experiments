 Do you love him?

 No, l-I just thought I'd ask the blunt question in case it was the right question and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you so you’d never been able to talk about it even though you might have wanted to... 

 So, that’s a no then?

 Probably. I think it all hangs on the next song.

 Worst DJ in the world.

 Hi Harry

 Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

 Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

 Do you think everybody knows? 

 Do you think Karl knows? 

 Oh, that is... that is bad news.

 Like what? 

 You know that? 

 Certainly. Excellent. Will do. Thanks, boss.

 Hi, Karl.

 Babe. Absolutely, fire away. Mia, could you turn that down? What is that?

 Night, Karl. Yup, absolutely. Free as a bird. Fire away.

 No. I've done fuck-all and never will because he's too good for me.

 Stop.

 Hello. Hi. How you doing?

 I suppose it's his job to dance with everyone, isn't it?

 Who, me?

 No! No! Good. Yes. Thanks.

 OK.

 Good night.

 Right. Good. I mean... No, that's good.

 Just, erm, would you excuse me for one second?

 Just one second.

 OK, that's done. m...Why don't you come upstairs in about ten seconds?

 Ten seconds.

 l-I'd better answer that. Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.No, no, I'm not busy. No, fire away.

 Sorry about that. 

 It's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.

 No, it's fine. It's fine. I mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is, and there being no parents now and us being over here, it's my job to keep an eye on him. Not my job, obviously, I'm glad to do it...

 No.

 Hey. How you doing? Right, right. Oh, no, please.

 Have you been watching stuff on TV?

 Good.

 Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.

 Thank you. Don't do that, my darling. Thank you. Don't do that.

 Night, Karl.

  Merry Christmas.

 Hi, babe, how's it going? Yeah. Is it all party, party, party down there?
