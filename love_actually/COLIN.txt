 Best sandwiches in Britain. Try my lovely nuts? Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady. Morning, my future wife.

 Delicious delicacy? 

 Taste explosion? Food? 

 Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it? Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh. Tastes like it, too. I'm Colin, by the way.

 What do you do, Nancy? 

 Ever do weddings? 

 They should've asked you to do this one. 

 God, I wish you hadn't turned it down. 

 Right.

 I've worked out why I can't find true love. 

 It’s English girls. They're stuck up, you see. And I am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler, game for a laugh. Like American girls. So I should just go to America! I'd get a girlfriend there instantly. What do you think?

 No, that's where you're wrong. American girls would seriously dig me with my cute British accent.

 Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

 Never. I am Colin, God of Sex. I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

 Exciting news! 

 I've bought a ticket to the States. I'm off in three weeks.

 Yes! To a fantastic place called Wisconsin. 

 Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!

 Nah, Tone, you're just jealous. You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me than the whole of the United Kingdom. 

 No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William...without the weird family.

 Yes!

 Da!

 Ja, darling!

 Hey! 

 Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

 I bloody am. You think this backpack is full of clothes? Like hell it is.

 Yeah, back broken from too much sex.

 No, I am on shag highway, heading west.

 Take me to a bar. 

 Just any bar. Just your average American bar.

 Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please. King of beers. 

 Yes. –

 Yep. Basildon.

 Er, bottle.

 Er, straw.

 Table.

 I don't actually know. I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

 Yeah. - Yeah. Well, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.

 What?

 No, no, I think it'd be fine.

 There's a fourth? - Yeah.

 Really? Wow. Praise the Lord!

 Yahoo! Now, this is Harriet.
